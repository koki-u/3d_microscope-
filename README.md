# Kerr microscope using by 3Dprinting tech

The 3D data was edited to create a microscope that can observe the phenomenon of magnetic domains, which is the principle of CDs.

Conventional microscopes for observing magnetic domains are usually several million units. However, this microscope has made it possible at a cost of about 100,000 yen.
At least, we have succeeded in reducing the cost by a factor of 10.
