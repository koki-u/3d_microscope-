# Kerr microscope using by 3Dprinting tech

# The original data is https://openflexure.org/

The 3D data was edited to create a microscope that can observe the phenomenon of magnetic domains, which is the principle of CDs.

Conventional microscopes for observing magnetic domains are usually several million units. However, this microscope has made it possible at a cost of about 30,000 yen.
At least, we have succeeded in reducing the cost by a factor of 10.

Notice : When you are printing "angle_part.stl". Please print facing horizontally. Because this part is very fragile when you print vertical. Of course, print with the support material attached.
